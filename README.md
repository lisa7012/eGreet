eGreet is a web application that allows users to customize and send free eCards to anyone they would like for free. They would start by browsing our photo gallery (photos provided by [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/)). Then, followed by filling in a form with the recipient's email, customizing their card, and finally sending it. Recipients receive their card via an email from eGreet which includes a link to view and download in browser. It was a very nice collaboration with a friend and I have learnt and used new techs in this project. 

> [!NOTE]
> Recipients may not be able to view the card in their email due to their email service providers not supporting or blocking the image source. However, they may view their card in browser with the link provided.
